# Gluwacoin

Gluwacoin is a cryptographic token standard. It extends the ERC20 standard for tokens and adds functions for cross-blockchain exchanges. The issuer can create Gluwacoin by different types of minting mechanisms such as wrapping, locking, or pegging and by pegging it to a different underlying asset. For example, you can wrap USD Coin into a Gluwacoin. Further, Gluwacoin supports its users to pay network fees in the token, not the cryptocurrency of the network.
