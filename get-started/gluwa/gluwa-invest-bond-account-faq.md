# Gluwa Invest \(Bond Account\) FAQ

## When can I draw down my funds after my investment?

Deposits/Subscriptions in the the Gluwa Invest Bond Account have a 3 month maturity period. This means these funds will be locked on the smart contract for this duration and you will not be able to draw down on these deposited funds plus your interest until 3 months has elapsed.

Each subsequent deposit/subscription will be locked for same period until 3 months have elapsed.

The below document types are acceptable address proofs however, they are not sufficient on their own -we require the address proof to be **certified as a true copy of the original**.

The document must clearly show your name and must match the residential address you provided during user sign-up.

**Single Document** **Address Proofs** \(must be issued/dated within last 3 months\)

* _Utility bill/invoice_ \(water or electric\)
* _Bank statement_
* _Letter/Certificate/Statement from a Tax Authority_
